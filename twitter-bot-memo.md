## Twitter bot memo

I want to make a bot called "Millennial facts" which goes through Twitter looking for tweets with phrases like "millennials are" or "millennials like," takes that text and and retweets it with the added comment, “Fact!” In practice, when the account @1NatashaStevens sends out the [tweet](https://twitter.com/1NatashaStevens/status/587820884603318273) “Millennials are very opinionated, which often comes off as judgmental & critical which leads them to a low or zero tolerance. #BeCareful” the bot would then tweet out

	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Fact! <a href="https://t.co/Lm1WA610PZ">https://t.co/Lm1WA610PZ</a></p>&mdash; Millennial facts (@millennial_fact) <a href="https://twitter.com/millennial_fact/status/590923912218746881">April 22, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It would even pick up this tweet: https://twitter.com/dancow/status/590585021896990721

It could be amusing, but more than anything I'm interested in seeing what all people are writing about millennials on social media. I predict I'll catch some "fun" think pieces on millennials and some random commentary from individuals. I’ve already signed up for a Twitter account with the handle @millennial_fact
